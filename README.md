The Aspiring Researcher Challenge is an experimental initiative by professors from Univ. of California and Stanford to recognize the potential of upcoming student researchers and exploring the possibility of massive research collaboration between the two.

Real world computer vision systems typically have some intrinsic value in their underlying business use. Serving the the right image in a search result ad might be worth $0.001 and counting nuclear particles in material images might be worth $10,000. In general we want to build systems which produce sufficiently accurate results within the budget. Although human interaction can improve accuracy in many algorithms, it also costs money. Most computer vision research has focused on purely automated algorithms, arguing that human labor is much too expensive to include in operational algorithms. This is equivalent to finding solutions for the $0.00 value case. We should explicitly investigate joint algorithms using computers and human labor, and report accuracy as a Cost vs Accuracy curve as additional human labor is inserted. We investigate some representative computer vision tasks, e.g. Object Detection, Image Matching, and X. We introduce several general strategies for combining existing vision algorithms with human labor, e.g. PruneFalsePositives, Y, Z. These strategies provide for increased accuracy in those cases when the task has positive value


What is OpenCV
=============
According to wikipedia ,OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision, developed by Intel Russia research center in Nizhny Novgorod, and now supported by Willow Garage and Itseez.[1] It is free for use under the open-source BSD license. The library is cross-platform. It focuses mainly on real-time image processing. If the library finds Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives on the system, it will use these proprietary optimized routines to accelerate itself.

This guide intends to cover the instalation tutorial of OpenCV in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or Debian.
